## Content Strategy - Gamifying content (by [*James Offer*](https://twitter.com/joffley))

- Gamification means using game mechanics to engage users and encourage desirable behavior
	- Example: Comparison of Australian party broadband policies - Wikipedia wall of text vs upload/download simulation => simulation is more satisfying to the user and more likely to be consumed

- UX hierarchy of needs - use gamification to achieve goals towards the top

*UX Hierarchy of Needs from [contrast.ie](http://www.contrast.ie/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/pyramid-diagram.jpg)*

- Reward users with badges, scores etc

- Can create illusion of choice/impact while controlling user's experience

- Feedback loop - provide quick satisfaction
	- Popularity of parallax sites because they react to what the user is doing
	- Example [Dangers of Fracking site](http://www.dangersoffracking.com/) 

- Appeal of endless games: progress indicators, constant new content, leaderboards

- Advantage of infographic flow charts over quizzes: easier to explore different routes and potential outcomes - quiz requires following one path at a time

## Different client groups and their fears *(by (Ruth Smith)[https://twitter.com/rufusboo])

- Combine stereotypes to handle different clients/situations
- Ask if explanations were clear

### 1. Dinosaurs

- focus on one skill and are less good at others (where they are bringing in external expertise)
- => requires concise high-level understandable language focussing on outcomes

### 2. Know-it-all

- Dominate conversation, have outdated knowledge
- => Encourage them to talk about their goals and problems
- => Clarify reporting requirements - they care about internals and are prone to demand to much detail

### 3. Mr. Busy

- Difficult to get responses/set up meetings
- => Take advantages of meetings when they do happen by preparing and moving as far as possible
- => Ask if there is an alternative contact when the client is busy


## How to F*#k it all up *(by (Graham Davidson)[https://twitter.com/jgtweeting])*


- Working with friends/family is nightmare/will go wrong, changes relationship dynamic, expect cheaper prices
- No work leads to procrastination, even when telling yourself to get work done
	- Suggests Pomodoro technique
- Be memorable, e.g. mailng people a lottery ticket will get their attention
- If clients suggest low prices, take out functionality/reduce scope instead of compromising on rate
- don;t promising things you can't deliver, can't learn things on the job by taking on a project
- Get written scope signed off, don't just do scope changes for free
- Working from home is accepted, no need for an office to be taken seriously
