Talk by [Paulina Sygulska](https://twitter.com/Payah) from GrantTree at Skills Matter.

## GrantTree

- Helps companies raise government funding, 9m raised so far
- 3 years old
- 14 employees
- &pound;1.8m in total revenue

Started to expand team after 18 months -> issues with pulling in different directions.

## The Old

- Gant charts, Reporting lines, Compensation metrics

## The New

- Everybody should work to make the company successful: self-management of competent people

## The New

- Company accounts open to all employees

## The Really Scary

- Employees set salaries
- Starting by asking people what they thought their colleagues should earn
- Percentage of revenues goes to salaries, office facilities, bonuses - employees want responsibility and decide revenue distribution and spending
