- [Andrew Fogg](https://twitter.com/andrewfogg), founder of import.io on negotiation.
- [import.io](https://import.io/): turn any website into a spreadsheet or an API
- People negotiate every day and try to motivate teams, customers and investors to do stuff

## 1) Getting a meeting

- Clearly articulate to yourself who you want to meet, what's their job title and role in their organization?
- Try to get introductions from others first
- Once you know who you want to meet, find out where they go to meet people
- When agreeing on meeting send calendar invite so it can go straight into the diary

## 2) Getting a deal

- Either help businesses save money or help them make money
- Then either
    - Identify a budget that is spent with another supplier, so they don't have to find new budget
    - Insert your product into the customer acquisition procress -> then more money spent with you always means they make more money
- Avoid joint venture/profit share
- Ask for a lot then come down
- Avoid positional bargaining (focussing on one number, e.g price, instead should do negotiate scope/IP/...)

## 3) Getting a contract

- Get one written/find content online
- Everyone wants to sign on their own paperwork, you should too
- Avoid redlines, people insisting on their own terms
    - Have a 'standard' document on your website and reference that, customer is less likely to want much customization
    - At first fight all changes then concede later so people can report successes in their organization

## 4) Getting an upgrade

- Smile and build rapport as quickly as possible, plans for weekend, chilren, etc.
- Ask people whether what you are about to buy is good.
