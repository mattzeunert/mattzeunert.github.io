## [Emre Baran](https://twitter.com/Emre) (Qubit)

- Not hiring developers but empowered engineers
- High retention rate
- No contracts (wouldn't be part of culture and long-term plan)
- Intrinsic desire to build: have they built something because they wanted to and are they willing to take ownership?
- Use new technologies in product: ensure people are willng to embrace change and contribute new ideas
- **Engineers don't report to their tech lead but directly to founder**
- A lot of task automation

## [Douglas Squirrel](https://twitter.com/douglassquirrel) (SecretSales/Osper)

- Keep developers free of generic IT tasks
- Humbleness: Solve important problems immediately
  - do IT tasks to let other developers work
  - doing cleaning tasks : very visible problem, raises appreciation by staff
- Unique "Secret Sauce" to attract developers:
  - Secret Sales: Continuous deployment

## [Joel Spolsky](https://twitter.com/spolsky) (Stack Exchange/Fog Creek)

- Started FogCreek to make a company that cares about developers
  - development in NY often treated as support function
- **Private offices** for developers to optimize productivity
  - Expensive and inflexible
  - Solution: **allow remote work**
- Needs easy communication to work together
  - Skype/Google Hangouts
  - overlapping workday
  - **ensure high-quality audio**
  - meet in person occasionally (but not as a big design meeting)
- Advantages of online meetings
  - access to computer during meeting
  - side comments/jokes don't interrupt
  - allows lurking while getting work done
- Avoid conference room meetings with remote participants
  - Poor audio
  - Conference room people might not have access to their computer/can't share screen or documents
