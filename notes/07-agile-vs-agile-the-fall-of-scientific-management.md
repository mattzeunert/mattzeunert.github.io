Talk by [Dr Laurie Young](http://twitter.com/wildfalcon) from New Bamboo at Skills Matter.

- Different mindsets and interpretations of agile
- Understand differences to make communicating about them easier
- Understand what mindset is best for your company

## Two mindsets

Aim: escape chaos and rejection of process.

### Scientific management

- Improve results by analysing work practices
- Managers should have control over practices
- Upside: it works, better than chaos
- Downside: Low employee motivation
- Downside: Slow to respond - data is gathered at the bottom of the org chart and needs to trickle up to enable a decision
- Downside: Communication doesn't happen hierarchically up-down, people across departments/levels talk to each other

### Complex systems / empowered teams

- Adapt to their constraints/changes in their environment
- Behavior is emergent/unpredictable
- Behavior is unstable

Examples:
- Ant colonies
- Stock market
- A team of people

## Differences between the mindsets

Origin of Agile Software Development: run projects better by joining planning and implementation

Agile manufacturing: measure waste in production, JIT manufacturing -> Kanban

Lean startup: Test hypotheses as you go along rather than developing big business plan up front

Corporate governance: lots of silence, separate departments, little communication across teams

## 3 Common uses of the word "Agile"

- A way of building projects with empowered teams
- A way of working with empowered teams
- A way of working that doesn't involve managers and hierarchy

## Summary

- 2 or 3 mindsets for how a company works
- Progression: Chaos -> Scientific Management -> Empowered teams
