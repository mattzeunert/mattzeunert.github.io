[Ian McCowatt](https://twitter.com/imccowatt) talks about the advantages of exploratory testing and automated tasks over automated tests.

## Robot paradigm:
- Whole tests
- Repeatability

### Implications of the robot/factory approach:
- Loss of human judgment
- Binary results (pass/fail) rather than judgements (does it fail if x vs at what x does it fail)
- Goal displacement (e.g. percentage of automated test)
- Gradual loss of information value (likelihood of a particular feature failing is low)

## Instrument paradigm

- Using instruments to assist testing

### Implications of the instrument paradigm:
- Research focus (answer questions about the software, exploratory testing)
- Extends and enhances - play to strengths of tools (repetition, precision, ...) and strength of humans (judgment)
- Potential (less narrow view of functionality)
