<p>
    I got a job in Shanghai in March, so my accomodation costs have been relatively stable at ¬£485 a month plus bills any hotels for travel.
    <br>
    My company provides breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but in October I started getting sick of having rice twice a day and started going to
    restaurants in the evening. Because I don't really eat at home "Everyday items" is very low throughout the year.<br>
    My fun budget goes up in August because I started taking Chinese lessons.

<h2>Bookkeeping</h2>
<p>
    I keep track of things in a plain text file on my phone that looks something like this:
</p>

<pre>
--- january 2018
use rmb
50o   starbucks
20e
9.99gbp monthly spotify
</pre>

<p>
    This means that in January 2018 I spent 50rmb eating out, spent 20rmb on everyday items (basically means supermarket), and will spend
9.99gbp a month on Spotify (categorized as "Fun").
</p>
<p>
    Using a plaintext file makes it super easy to enter new items.
    Much simpler than clicking "New", entering a value, selecting a currency, entering category, ....
</p>
<p>
    I then have a Node script that takes the text file and generates CSV report. Email me if you're interested in it.
</p>

<h2>Accounting</h2>
<p>
    Who doesn't love accounting! üòç
</p>
<p>
    I have the following main categories, with some examples of what they contain:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Accomodation: rent, hotels, AirBnbs, bills</li>
    <li>Transportation: flights, metro tickets, trains, ferries, taxis</li>
    <li>Eating out: restaurants, takeaways, Starbucks, bakeries, any food that is meant to be eaten straight away</li>
    <li>Fun: Chinese lessons, books, theme parks, phone</li>
    <li>Productivity: office rental, Github, domains, backup harddrive, monitor</li>
    <li>Occasional Purchaes: clothes, vaccinations, bed sheets</li>
    <li>Everyday purchases: supermarket items, phone credit, VPN, laundry</li>
    <li>Exercise: gym, swimming, badminton rackets</li>
    <li>Donations: regular donations, leaving leftover currency at the airport</li>
    <li>Other: travel insurance, visa fees</li>
</ul>

<p>
    I also have deeper levels of categories like "Everyday Purchases>Haircut" and "Accomodation>Bills>Gas".
</p>

<p>
    For some items I book the cost over several months or years. For example, my phone cost ¬£654 but instead of booking
    it as a one-off I depreciate it over 3 years, and book an expense of ¬£18.17 a month.<br>
    What should be split over several months? One criterium is, could I could recover a meaningful percentage of the purchase price
    if I sold the item? Or, is the item meant to be consumed over a longer period of time (e.g. gym membership, Chinese lessons)?
</p>

<p>
    Tracking productivity expenses is a bit tricky. Most of my travel expenses in 2017 were related to travelling to conferences.
    So that could also be tracked as productivity.<br>
    You can also see that unlike in October the travel in June and July did not increase my accomodation
    costs, because the conferences paid for it.
    <br>
    Any items that either my own company or my current employer pays for also won't be tracked here.
</p>
