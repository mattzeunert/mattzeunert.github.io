# DevTools Demo: Never Pause Here

A demo app to demonstrate a use case for Chrome's "Never pause here" feature.

If you open the `index.html` you'll see that the app doesn't render anything. You can use "Pause on caught exceptions" and "Never pause here" to debug the issue.

`debugger.html` is an example file to show how you can use "Never pause here" to disable a `debugger` statement.
