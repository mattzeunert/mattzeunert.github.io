Web development means building websites. How are websites different from mobile or desktop apps?

## Websites run in a browser

Going to a website is different from starting an app - first you need to open a browser like Internet Explorer, Chrome or Safari.

This is for security reasons. You are likely to visit a hundred different websites in a day, all of which can run code on your computer. The browser acts as a protective layer that restricts websites to actions that are safe. An application that you've installed on your computer has much greater control over your data.

This is called **sandboxing** - the computer doesn't trust the website and puts it in a safe environment where it can't cause any harm.

You don't install nearly as many different programs on your computer as you access websites. That's partly because installing desktop software is more work and partly because your computer trusts the software you install. Desktop apps have almost complete access to your data.

Mobile apps are in the middle of the trust spectrum. You probably noticed that your phone asks you for permission if an app wants to access your photos or GPS location.

## Websites use the technologies HTML, CSS and JavaScript

Because websites need the browser to function they can only use the technologies that the browser supports - and those are HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

These technologies are also *standardized*. Different browsers, on different operating systems, on different devices all work with the same HTML and CSS code.

While browser functionality is generally standardized different systems always have their unique behavior and inconsistencies. Older browsers also won't support all the functionality of modern browsers.

But overall it doesn't matter whether you have a Windows machine or iPad - you will most likely be able to load any public website on the internet.
