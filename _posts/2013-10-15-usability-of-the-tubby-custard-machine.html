<div class='post'>
    Say you want to <a href="https://youtu.be/lpdfBSb-8i8?t=768">make Tubby Custard</a>. It's a four-step process:
    <br />
    <ol>
        <li>Switch on the Tubby Custard machine</li>
        <li>Get bowl</li>
        <li>Lower custard tap</li>
        <li>Turn on custard dispenser</li>
    </ol>
    <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
        <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-i4ZsgP08aDQ/Ul0T7lOoiAI/AAAAAAAAAGk/yly3uquihgw/s1600/Screen+Shot+2013-10-15+at+10.53.00.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="212" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-i4ZsgP08aDQ/Ul0T7lOoiAI/AAAAAAAAAGk/yly3uquihgw/s320/Screen+Shot+2013-10-15+at+10.53.00.png" width="320" /></a>
    </div>
    <br />
    This is the control panel. Would you know what buttons to press and in what order?
    <br><br>
    You wouldn't. Tinky Winky also struggles, as the mapping between the buttons and machine's behavior is unclear.
    <br />
    <br />Although the machine is technically advanced - for example, it automatically detects when you take away the tubby custard bowl - it requires a lot of attention from its operator.
    <br />
    <br />
    <h4>Possible improvements</h4>
    Here are some suggestions. Note that they don't consider possible other functions of the machine as well as maintenance and accessibility requirements.
    <br />
    <ol>
        <li>Arrange the buttons in chronological order from left to right</li>
        <li>Prevent the dispenser from working if it hasn't been lowered over the bowl</li>
        <li>Communicate button functionality through the appearance of the buttons</li>
    </ol>
    For example, the second button from the left looks like the head of the tap. But it actually retrieves a bowl from the machine. To communicate this, the bowl should be depicted on the button.
    <br><br>
    The second button from the right lowers and raises the tap. Implementing it as a toggle would allow it to represent the two possible states the tap can be in.</li>
    <br><br>
    <div>(Ideally there'd only be one button for filling a bowl with Tubby Custard, which is presumably the main purpose of the machine. Toggle buttons could be used configure the recipe and bowl volume if required.)</div>
