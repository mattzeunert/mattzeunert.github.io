title: "HMRC cancelled my VAT registration, and how it got reinstated"

I started my company [DebugBear](https://www.debugbear.com/) a bit over a year ago, and registered for VAT right after. But then HMRC cancelled my VAT registration and and sorting that out was a huge problem that took over 6 months.

## What is VAT?

VAT is 

If you're a consumer and I'm a VAT registered business and I cut your hair for £10 I collect an extra 20% from you and give that to HMRC. But if I spent £6 on shampoo I can go to HMRC and reclaim the 20% vat on that.

## Why register for VAT?

- you can reclaim VAT on expenses, this is useful especailly since you'll likely make a loss in the beginning
- some EU suppliers of digital good only sell to VAT registered businesses in the EU
- (once your annual turnover is over £85,000 in the UK you are required to register for VAT) 

## Who can register for VAT?

Basically, if you actively run a business with the aim to make a meaningful amount of money you can register for VAT.





The [Value Added Tax Act of 1994(https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1994/23/schedule/1/crossheading/entitlement-to-be-registered) says that you either
have to make taxable supplies or running a business and intendig to make taxable supplies. I'd translate "making taxable supplies" as "sell stuff" (that you'd normally charge vat on).

HMRC also has something called the [business test](https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/vat-business-non-business/vbnb22000) with questions like these: 

-Is the activity a serious undertaking earnestly pursued?
- Is the activity an occupation or function, which is actively pursued with reasonable or recognisable continuity?
- Does the activity have a certain measure of substance in terms of the quarterly or annual value of taxable supplies made (bearing in mind that exempt supplies can also be business)?
- Is the activity conducted in a regular manner and on sound and recognised business principles?
- Are the taxable supplies that are being made of a kind which, subject to differences of detail, are commonly made by those who seek to profit from them?

Bascially you can't register for vat and reclaim vat your netflix subscription. Unless you're making a meaningful income from running a movie subscription business comparison or review site.
