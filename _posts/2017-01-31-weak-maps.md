title: Difference between Map and WeakMap in JavaScript
date: 2017-01-31

ES2015 introduced the new [`Map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map) and [`WeakMap`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WeakMap) objects to JavaScript. They can be used as a key-value store, but unlike normal objects in JavaScript you can use objects as keys. Keys for normal objects (`{}`) always have to be strings, and if you try to use an object it will be converted to a string (`[object Object]`).

## Using Maps

To assign values to a map you need to use the `set` method:

{% highlight javascript %}
window.obj = {}
var map = new Map()
map.set(window.obj, 123)
{% endhighlight %}

(You'll see later why I'm assigning `obj` to window rather than using a local variable.)

Then, to retrieve the object call `get`:

{% highlight javascript %}
map.get(window.obj) // => 123
{% endhighlight %}

## Difference between Map and WeakMap

The difference between Map and WeakMap lies in how the objects that are used as keys are treated during garbage collection.

Without the Maps, running `delete window.obj` would remove the only reference to the `obj` object, and the object would be removed from memory.

However, since `obj` is used as a key in our `Map` there still is a reference to `obj` and it can't be garbage collected.

`WeakMap`s however are different: they act as if there was no additional reference to `obj`. They only hold a weak reference to `obj`, meaning that after running removing the `obj` reference from the window object, `obj` can be garbage collected.

Let's change our code a bit to make `obj` use up more memory:

{% highlight javascript %}
function Obj(){
    this.val = new Array(10000000).join("---")
}

window.obj = new Obj();
var map = new Map()
map.set(window.obj, 123)
delete window.obj
{% endhighlight %}

If you run this in Chrome the memory consumption will rise by about 30MB. Here's the screenshot from the DevTools memory profiler:

Now let's try the same thing with a `WeakMap`: 

{% highlight javascript %}
function Obj(){
    this.val = new Array(10000000).join("---")
}

window.obj = new Obj();
var map = new WeakMap()
map.set(window.obj, 123)
delete window.obj
{% endhighlight %}

You can see from the heap snapshot that the memory used by `obj` has been garbage collected:

## Browser support for Map and WeakMap

The latest Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Safari support `Map` and `WeakMap` on desktop. There's no support in IE10.

On mobile newer browsers also have support, but IE Mobile doesn't.

## A gotcha when trying this in the console

When I was playing around in the DevTools console I ran into some trouble, because memory wasn't cleared up when I expected it to be.

It turned out that the problem was that the large object had been printed in the console, which caused Chrome to keep the object in memory.

The solution was to prevent `obj` being logged in the console. In this case I'm just adding a meaningless `123;` statement that appears in the console instead:
